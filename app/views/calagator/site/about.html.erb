  <h2>What</h2>
  <p>New York City Maritime Calendar is a unified calendar for public events about life and history on the waters of New York City. We are an all-volunteer effort and encourage anyone to import, create, and edit events.</p>
  <p>The Calendar aggregates events so that users can visit a single source to discover interesting activities.</p>
  <p>The open source software running this site is called Calagator. It was originally developed for the technology community of Portland, Oregon. You can read more about that project on <a href="https://calagator.org/about">its website</a> and <a href="https://calagator.wordpress.com">blog</a>. The source code for our friendly fork of the project is available <a href="https://github.com/windmountain/calagator/tree/maritime2">here on Github</a>.</p>
  <p>If you encounter any bugs or have feedback about the New York City Maritime Calendar, we appreciate hearing about it. Please email <a href="mailto:help@maritime.nyc">help@maritime.nyc</a>.
  <p>Basic administration is handled by Zach Rose, casual NYC maritime enthusiast.</p>
